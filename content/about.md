## How to work with me
I am a constant inventor, but with a twist. I am not tinkering with obscure data or reconfiguring trendy technology. Instead, I am initiating. I spend my time on novel undertakings that stretch the boundaries of current thinking and practice. I see the gaps in others' solutions and offer many (sometimes conflicting) alternatives and paradoxical insights.
I prioritize volume over the perfectly packaged idea, confident that the model solution lies somewhere within my mass of insights. I generate idea after idea, leaving others to hone my thinking. Throw me in the deep end. If there's a project that lacks details or data, I can get it off to a good start. I am resourceful and can fill gaps more quickly than most. Let me tackle new territory. If it's never been done before, I am at my best.
